# TES3MP-Partyhealth-Add-on


## What it does:
You can add another Player into your Friendlist.
Then if ```Friend1``` 'Activates' ```Friend2``` he gets continuous update of ```Friend2```'s health as GUI or CHAT message.

There is also a Blacklist so nobody can bother you multiple times.

If you follow the instructions Friendlist will display current locations of online friends.




## How to INSTALL:
1. Download the ```main.lua``` and put it in */server/scripts/custom/Partyhealth*
2. Open ```customScripts.lua``` and add this code on separate line: ```Partyhealth = require "custom/Partyhealth/main"```
3. Download the locations.lua and put it in *server/scripts/* (friendlist will display current location of online friends)


## How to do it in-game (if it needs further explanation):

Approach another ```Player``` and hit the button which you use for opening ```doors```.

For list of commands type in the chat: /ph.help
